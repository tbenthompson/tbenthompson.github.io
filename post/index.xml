      <description>Collaboration in an unstructured world While I haven&amp;rsquo;t made any decisions yet, I&amp;rsquo;m currently considering heading off into a much less structured career path which could be variously described as &amp;ldquo;independent scientist&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;entrepreneuer&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;contractor&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;self-employed open-source developer&amp;rdquo;. Along those lines, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering what makes work good for me and how I can put the pieces together reliably. I think the critical piece will be to proactively communicate with lots of people.</description>

      <title>Maybe we should stop using planar triangles for fault modeling.</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a model problem where the goal is to calculate the stress on a fault due to some slip on that fault. We also include a topographic free surface. How should we model this surface?
Should we use planar triangles to model a curved fault? What happens at the junction between two triangles? If we do the natural fault thing and require the slip to be tangential to the suface, the slip vector has a step function at the junction between the two triangles.</description>

      <title>Regularizing rate and state friction for numerical simulation.</title>
      <link>http://tbenthompson.com/post/regularized_rate_state/</link>

      <description>The standard form for rate and state friction produces undefined results for $V = 0$. Some algebra and calculus and microphysics lead to the commonly used regularized form that is still valid at $V=0$. This is based on the presentation in Rice and Ben-Zion 1996 and Lapusta et. al 2000. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing novel here, but the details of this sort of thing are often glossed over in the literature. So, while working it out for myself, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write it up!</description>

      <title>A quasidynamic spring block slider</title>

Figures first, explanations later!
Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some 3D quasidynamic earthquake modeling problems. We&amp;rsquo;re planning to add in some realistic geometries using tectosaur to see what influence that has on the earthquake cycle. While putting together that 3D model, I realized that it consists of two main pieces:
 The numerical methods for determining traction on the fault surface given the current values of slip everywhere on the fault (elasticity!</description>

      <title>Cloudpickle, serializing functions and monkey patching</title>
      <link>http://tbenthompson.com/post/cloudpickle_monkey_patching/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using cloudpickle in the internals of taskloaf for a while since it allows serializing almost all functions and objects. That&amp;rsquo;s really nice since it means I can pass arbitrary functions (tasks, jobs) from one worker to another across the network.
Yesterday, I was curious about the internals of cloudpickle and whether a monkey-patched object would remain patched after being loaded remotely. I read a bit of the source, but figured just trying it was a good idea.</description>

      <title>My Python testing set up</title>

      <description>To follow up on the last post about testing for science and data analytics, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to talk about the specific tools I use for testing. I don&amp;rsquo;t claim this is the best way to do things, but it tends to work pretty well for small projects and teams.
py.test The py.test tool is handy for running a suite of tests in python. It&amp;rsquo;s a very general tool for running all the tests in a project.</description>

      <title>Automated testing for scientists and data analysts</title>

      <description>A lot of scientists and data analysts don&amp;rsquo;t use automatic test suites for verifying their code. And I think that&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s really hard. Almost all the introductions to automated testing that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen come from a more typical software engineering perspective. They assume you already know exactly what the output of your code should be. And the trouble with science is that that&amp;rsquo;s rarely the case. I mean, if you knew the results ahead of time, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing science!</description>

      <title>Sparse n-body matrices</title>
      <link>http://tbenthompson.com/post/sparse_nbody/</link>

      <guid>http://tbenthompson.com/post/sparse_nbody/</guid>
      <description>This is a sparsity plot of a matrix representing an approximate n-body interaction. The black dots are non-zeros in the matrix. Imagine 2000 stars, each exerting some gravitational pull on each of the other stars. This gravitational interaction could be represented by a dense matrix:
$$ A_{ij} = \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j|^2} $$
This works, but dense matrices can be slow when there are many stars. The cost of evaluating a matrix-vector product will scale like $O(n^2)$.</description>

      <title>Setting up my website</title>
      <link>http://tbenthompson.com/post/setting_up_website/</link>

      <description>I have a website now. Since technical stuff is fun, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share the way I set it up.
The site is a set of statically served HTML pages. Hugo makes this really easy. Hugo is super fast and is written in Go. You can set up a few template pages and then write posts and pages in Markdown. Some layout is also done using Go templates. Running Hugo takes your templates and pages and concerts them into static HTML.</description>
