      <title>Geometrically complex quasidynamic earthquake ruptures</title>

      <description>Earthquake modelling normally involves a planar fault in an elastic half or full space. Over the past couple years, I have looked at what happens to static earthquake models when we add fault geometry, surface topography and Earth curvature. There are some large and interesting effects. I am now looking into the influence of these geometric effects on quasidynamic and dynamic earthquake rupture models. A lot of research has been directed towards to complex, nonlinear effects of rheology and friction laws in rupture modeling.</description>

      <title>The Earth isn’t flat: The large influence of topography on geodetic fault slip imaging.</title>

      <description>Images of earthquake slip typically rely on flat Earth physical models to link surface observations to fault activity at depth despite the extreme topographic relief (20%) in vicinity of recent great earthquakes (e.g., 2008 $M_w$=7.9 Wenchuan). Here we use a three-dimensional boundary element approach to characterize the effects of realistic topography on coseismic slip inversions and find that near the steepest topography, the flat Earth assumption may induce errors $&amp;gt;100%$ in imaged coseismic slip.</description>

      <title>Tectosaur: Powerful and efficient boundary element software</title>
      <link>http://tbenthompson.com/project/tectosaur/</link>

      <description>Our tectonic and earthquake cycle research is supported by development of elastic boundary element software. This has required investigations into the best approaches for a wide range of computational and mathematical tasks: singular integration of Green&amp;rsquo;s functions, approximation of farfield Green&amp;rsquo;s function interactions with the fast multipole method, flexible treatment of equality and inequality constraints, and a big dose of computational geometry. These are a just a few of the components of this effort.</description>

      <title>Taskloaf: Simplified distributed task parallelism</title>
      <link>http://tbenthompson.com/project/taskloaf/</link>

      <description>Taskloaf GitHub page
Task-based parallelism enables running complex parallel computations by describing them as a graph of tasks. Shared memory task-based parallelism has become an important tool as demonstrated by tools like Intel TBB, Cilk, and OpenMP v3. But, distributed memory task-based parallelism systems is still heavily researched to determine the most usable, efficient and scalable approach. Instead of waiting for the future holy grail of distributed task parallelism, I designed Taskloaf while visiting Oak Ridge National Lab in Fall 2015.</description>

      <title>Crustal stress estimation in the Himalayan wedge</title>

      <description>Quantitative estimates of crustal stress magnitude and orientation are hard to come by. On the other hand, geodesy is providing an increasingly accurate picture of global tectonic motions. Field and laboratory analyses contribute fault slip rates and exhumation rates. Seismology yields estimates of stress from moment tensor analyses. I am working to combine these data sources with geometrically accurate elastic boundary element models to estimate the crustal stress field and the driving forces behind those stresses &amp;ndash; for example, mantle tractions on the base of the crust.</description>

      <title>Longmen Shan fault geometry and slip rates</title>
      <link>http://tbenthompson.com/project/longmenshan/</link>

      <description>GRL article.
The Longmen Shan is the steepest topographic front at the India‐Asia collision zone and the site of the Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. To explain the interseismic GPS velocities across the greater Longmen Shan region, we developed a boundary element model including earthquake cycle effects, topography, the westward dipping Beichuan Fault and a ∼20 km deep, shallowly dipping, detachment, inferred from observed afterslip and from structural considerations. Prior analyses which had neglected the detachment and earthquake cycle effects found shortening rates near zero.</description>

      <title>Neotectonics of the Shargyn Basin, western Mongolia</title>

      <description>My undergraduate thesis. Western Mongolia has experienced four of the largest strike-slip earthquakes in recorded history. The Gobi-Altai fault system is a 500km long left-lateral slip zone. The Altai fault system is a 1000km long right-lateral slip zone. Combined these fault systems accomodate 10-15% of the shortening in the Indo-Eurasian collision. At the intersection, complex kinematics have created a 150 x 100km basin, called the Shargyn Basin. I propose an explanation for the kinematics of the ongoing formation of the basin.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Microscale Rock Deformation</title>
      <link>http://tbenthompson.com/project/microscale/</link>

      <description>github
For an undergraduate research project, I worked with Alejandra to automate a procedure to quantify finite strain on a microscale. On a certain surface, a sample is etched (like a microprocessor) with spaced dots. Then, on a microscope photograph, the dot positions are recorded before and after deformation. However, tracking hundreds of thousands of these dots by hand is impossible. So, I worked on an algorithm to determine the deformation function between the initial and final images by tracking the dot positions.</description>

I worked for a while as the primary software developer for TherapyCharts, a web-based therapist records system. I developed a Python and PostgreSQL based backend and a ExtJS interface. I participated in two American Psychological Association conferences performing support and sales for TherapyCharts. TherapyCharts has now partnered with Wiley Publishing and is known as “Therascribe powered by TherapyCharts”.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Melanoma</title>

      <description>In high school, I was very interested in machine learning algorithms and investigated neural networks, support vector machines and unsupervised learning. I replicated various algorithms and tested their properties at different points in parameter space on the MNIST dataset which contains 60,000 handwritten numbers. Later, I used an unsupervised learning technique (Autoencoders, Hinton et. al 2006) to improve the performance of a support vector machine model in detecting Melanoma (skin cancer).</description>
