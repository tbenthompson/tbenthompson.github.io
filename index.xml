I&amp;rsquo;m particularly excited about being part of the team that released the first two open source packages from QuantCo. We built glum as the generalized linear modeling package that we had all wished existed. And that project led to tabmat as a backend for efficiently working with tabular matrix data containing a mix of dense, sparse and categorical subcomponents.</description></item><item><title>cppimport: Import C++ files directly from Python!</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/cppimport/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/cppimport/</guid><description>See the GitHub repo</description></item><item><title>GPU-accelerated symmetric Galerkin boundary element software</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/tectosaur/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/tectosaur/</guid><description>A recent paper outlining our Galerkin BEM approach.
My tectonic and earthquake cycle research is supported by development of elastic boundary element software. This has required investigations into the best approaches for a wide range of computational and mathematical tasks: singular integration of Green&amp;rsquo;s functions, approximation of farfield Green&amp;rsquo;s function interactions with the fast multipole method, flexible treatment of equality and inequality constraints, and a big dose of computational geometry. These are a just a few of the components of this effort.</description></item><item><title>Earthquake cycle modeling of the Cascadia subduction zone</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/quasidynamic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/quasidynamic/</guid><description>Paper
The Cascadia subduction zone hosts great $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{W} &amp;gt; 8.5$ earthquakes, but studying these events is hindered by our short observational record. Earthquake cycle simulation provides an alternative window into the behavior of the subduction zone. Here, we present simulations over 3,800 years, 14 ruptures and hundreds of slow slip events on a high-fidelity geometric representation of the Cascadia subduction zone beneath surface topography. The boundaries of these ruptures are defined by ephemeral stress barriers that last for several cycles but are eliminated by a barrier-crossing rupture.</description></item><item><title>Topography and the shallow slip deficit inference</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/topography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/topography/</guid><description>Paper
Images of earthquake slip typically rely on flat Earth physical models to link surface observations to fault activity at depth despite the extreme topographic relief (20%) in vicinity of recent great earthquakes (e.g., 2008 $M_w$=7.9 Wenchuan). Here we use a three-dimensional boundary element approach to characterize the effects of realistic topography on coseismic slip inversions and find that near the steepest topography, the flat Earth assumption may induce errors $&amp;gt;100%$ in imaged coseismic slip.</description></item><item><title>Simplified distributed task parallelism</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/taskloaf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/taskloaf/</guid><description>Task-based parallelism enables running complex parallel computations by describing them as a graph of tasks. Shared memory task-based parallelism has become an important tool as demonstrated by tools like Intel TBB, Cilk, and OpenMP v3. But, distributed memory task-based parallelism systems is still heavily researched to determine the most usable, efficient and scalable approach. Instead of waiting for the future holy grail of distributed task parallelism, I designed Taskloaf while visiting Oak Ridge National Lab in Fall 2015.</description></item><item><title>Neural-net-accelerated viscoelastic calculations.</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/visconn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/visconn/</guid><description>The viscous behavior of the deep Earth results in slow surface motion continuing for many years after an earthquake. However, computing the physics of this behavior can be extremely expensive involving multi-dimensional inverse Laplace transforms and slowly-convergent series. We developed a basic feedforward neural network that is able to replicate the results of the analytic computation while running ~500x faster. Since the analytic function being approximated is already known, this is a sort of strange application of neural networks in that they are very explicitly being used in their role as universal function approximators for a high-dimensional function.</description></item><item><title>Crustal stress estimation in the Himalayan wedge</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/himalaya_stress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/himalaya_stress/</guid><description>Quantitative estimates of crustal stress magnitude and orientation are hard to come by. On the other hand, geodesy is providing an increasingly accurate picture of global tectonic motions. Field and laboratory analyses contribute fault slip rates and exhumation rates. Seismology yields estimates of stress from moment tensor analyses. I am working to combine these data sources with geometrically accurate elastic boundary element models to estimate the crustal stress field and the driving forces behind those stresses &amp;ndash; for example, mantle tractions on the base of the crust.</description></item><item><title>Longmen Shan fault geometry and slip rates</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/longmenshan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/longmenshan/</guid><description>GRL article.
The Longmen Shan is the steepest topographic front at the India‐Asia collision zone and the site of the Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. To explain the interseismic GPS velocities across the greater Longmen Shan region, we developed a boundary element model including earthquake cycle effects, topography, the westward dipping Beichuan Fault and a ∼20 km deep, shallowly dipping, detachment, inferred from observed afterslip and from structural considerations. Prior analyses which had neglected the detachment and earthquake cycle effects found shortening rates near zero.</description></item><item><title>Neotectonics of the Shargyn Basin, western Mongolia</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/shargyn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/shargyn/</guid><description>My undergraduate thesis. Western Mongolia has experienced four of the largest strike-slip earthquakes in recorded history. The Gobi-Altai fault system is a 500km long left-lateral slip zone. The Altai fault system is a 1000km long right-lateral slip zone. Combined these fault systems accomodate 10-15% of the shortening in the Indo-Eurasian collision. At the intersection, complex kinematics have created a 150 x 100km basin, called the Shargyn Basin. I propose an explanation for the kinematics of the ongoing formation of the basin.</description></item><item><title>Machine vision for microscale rock deformation</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/microscale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/microscale/</guid><description>github
For an undergraduate research project, I worked with Alejandra to automate a procedure to quantify finite strain on a microscale. On a certain surface, a sample is etched (like a microprocessor) with spaced dots. Then, on a microscope photograph, the dot positions are recorded before and after deformation. However, tracking hundreds of thousands of these dots by hand is impossible. So, I worked on an algorithm to determine the deformation function between the initial and final images by tracking the dot positions.</description></item><item><title>TherapyCharts</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/therapycharts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/therapycharts/</guid><description>homepage
I worked for a while as the primary software developer for TherapyCharts, a web-based therapist records system. I developed a Python and PostgreSQL based backend and a ExtJS interface. I participated in two American Psychological Association conferences performing support and sales for TherapyCharts. TherapyCharts has now partnered with Wiley Publishing and is known as “Therascribe powered by TherapyCharts”.</description></item><item><title>Machine learning, neural networks, and melanoma</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/neuralnets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/neuralnets/</guid><description>In high school, I was very interested in machine learning algorithms and investigated neural networks, support vector machines and unsupervised learning. I replicated various algorithms and tested their properties at different points in parameter space on the MNIST dataset which contains 60,000 handwritten numbers. Later, I used an unsupervised learning technique (Autoencoders, Hinton et. al 2006) to improve the performance of a support vector machine model in detecting Melanoma (skin cancer).</description></item><item><title>Some thoughts on my ideal publication system.</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/ideal_publication/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/ideal_publication/</guid><description>Two common users of the scientific literature:
The newbie/shallow learner: they are just getting into a field and need to understand some subject. The deep researcher: they spend their days doing research in this area and need to keep up to date with what other researchers are doing. Currently, the scientific literature doesn’t really satisfy either type of user:
Newbies need more review articles and textbooks. These are often not available for concepts and research from the last 10 years.</description></item><item><title>Unexpectedly sucky things I've noticed about grad school</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/grad_school/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/grad_school/</guid><description>Summary: I think graduate school is largely a mistake for everyone involved.1 Graduate students are poorly paid, low-skill but high potential, junior employees who need a lot more supervision and mentorship.
Problems:
Graduate students in many fields are thrust into a role where they need to decide on a research direction. Developing research taste is difficult and expecting graduate students to succeed at this is a great way to be disappointed.</description></item><item><title>FAQ: Why should research scientists be at the center of our scientific workforce?</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/reasons_for_research_scientists/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/reasons_for_research_scientists/</guid><description>Ideally, this will be a living document. I just hit publish on this because I&amp;rsquo;m impulsive but it probably needs some serious editing. This was last updated on 1/7/2022.
In most research settings, research scientists are the central characters. In industrial research, experienced research scientists and engineers are well paid and prestigious. In national labs, the main career path is as a research scientist. But in academia, research scientists are few and far between.</description></item><item><title>We need technical research consultants.</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/technical_research_consulting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/technical_research_consulting/</guid><description>Prelude: Research scientists and research consultants. This is a proposal for a new type of research organization that would provide technical support, particularly on things like lab equipment or computational methods or software: technical competencies that take a long time to develop and are mostly independent of the particular lab environment.
There&amp;rsquo;s a spectrum of hands-on technical researchers. On the one hand, research scientists are full-time technically talented team members that execute on research plans.</description></item><item><title>Open source release! Generalized linear modeling with glum and tabmat.</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/glum_tabmat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/glum_tabmat/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m super excited to announce the release of glum and tabmat. These are the first two open source projects that QuantCo has released! Hopefully there will be many more. glum is a efficient and featureful Python-first library for generalized linear model (GLM) estimation built with an sklearn-style API. We focused a ton on correctness, performance and satisfying a wide range of feature requirements.
While working on this project, my coworkers and I heard repeatedly from folks on other data science or economics teams that they either struggled with the same GLM software problems we had or they had built their own internal GLM tool similar to glum.</description></item><item><title>50 suggestions on correctness and testing for scientific software for PDEs</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/testing_scientific_software/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/testing_scientific_software/</guid><description>I think testing and debugging is one of the harder aspects of scientific and numerical software. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get buried in giant pile of code and have no idea where to look for bugs. It&amp;rsquo;s even harder when actually the bug isn&amp;rsquo;t in the code but is in the concepts, math or data.
The fundamental problem with testing and debugging scientific software is that we don&amp;rsquo;t know correct intermediate values or even the correct final output.</description></item><item><title>Gaussian quadrature is not optimal</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/better_than_gauss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/better_than_gauss/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s conventional wisdom that Gaussian quadrature is the most point-efficient quadrature formula for analytic functions. But, it&amp;rsquo;s not true! &amp;ldquo;New quadrature formulas from conformal maps&amp;rdquo; by Hale and Trefethen (2008) demonstrates that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to have quadrature formulas that converge about 50% faster for analytic functions. The paper is quite accessible and I encourage you to read it, but I also wanted to help bring attention to it since it seems like it should be more well-known.</description></item><item><title>Reflective deep work</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/reflective_deep_work/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/reflective_deep_work/</guid><description>You might also call this introspective deep work, or self-reflective deep work.
I just finished reading Deep Work and it has me thinking about applying a few of the concepts well beyond my career. &amp;ldquo;Deep work&amp;rdquo; is all about making space for the hard intellectual work at the core of most knowledge workers&amp;rsquo; jobs. But, the concept of making space in your day or week or month for deep thought seems like it should apply well beyond my career.</description></item><item><title>Why it's okay to share your code</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/share_your_code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/share_your_code/</guid><description>TL;DR: If you write a paper that involves complex code, share your code freely online. Don&amp;rsquo;t make it pretty. Don&amp;rsquo;t make it easy to use. Refuse to support the code. Just share it!
People have talked a lot already about why it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to share code with your research. I want to address a specific component of this. The desire to share good, well-maintained code often becomes a barrier to sharing any code at all.</description></item><item><title>Maintaining momentum</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/maintaining_momentum/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/maintaining_momentum/</guid><description>Collaboration in an unstructured world While I haven&amp;rsquo;t made any decisions yet, I&amp;rsquo;m currently considering heading off into a much less structured career path which could be variously described as &amp;ldquo;independent scientist&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;entrepreneuer&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;contractor&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;self-employed open-source developer&amp;rdquo;. Along those lines, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering what makes work good for me and how I can put the pieces together reliably. I think the critical piece will be to proactively communicate with lots of people.</description></item><item><title>Maybe we should stop using planar triangles for fault modeling</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/surface_representation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/surface_representation/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a model problem where the goal is to calculate the stress on a fault due to some slip on that fault. We also include a topographic free surface. How should we model this surface?
Should we use planar triangles to model a curved fault? What happens at the junction between two triangles? If we do the natural fault thing and require the slip to be tangential to the suface, the slip vector has a step function at the junction between the two triangles.</description></item><item><title>Cool video of Cascadia earthquake cycle simulations</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cascadia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cascadia/</guid><description/></item><item><title>130 million triangular dislocations per second with Python/CUDA</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cutde/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cutde/</guid><description>See the GitHub repo</description></item><item><title>CLUDA - Write once, run anywhere with both CUDA and OpenCL.</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cluda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cluda/</guid><description>See the GitHub repo</description></item><item><title>Regularizing rate and state friction for numerical simulation</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/regularized_rate_state/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/regularized_rate_state/</guid><description>The standard form for rate and state friction produces undefined results for $V = 0$. Some algebra and calculus and microphysics lead to the commonly used regularized form that is still valid at $V=0$. This is based on the presentation in Rice and Ben-Zion 1996 and Lapusta et. al 2000. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing novel here, but the details of this sort of thing are often glossed over in the literature. So, while working it out for myself, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write it up!</description></item><item><title>A quasidynamic spring block slider</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/block_slider/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/block_slider/</guid><description>source available here
Figures first, explanations later!
Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some 3D quasidynamic earthquake modeling problems. We&amp;rsquo;re planning to add in some realistic geometries using tectosaur to see what influence that has on the earthquake cycle. While putting together that 3D model, I realized that it consists of two main pieces:
The numerical methods for determining traction on the fault surface given the current values of slip everywhere on the fault (elasticity!</description></item><item><title>Cloudpickle, serializing functions and monkey patching</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cloudpickle_monkey_patching/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cloudpickle_monkey_patching/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using cloudpickle in the internals of taskloaf for a while since it allows serializing almost all functions and objects. That&amp;rsquo;s really nice since it means I can pass arbitrary functions (tasks, jobs) from one worker to another across the network.
Yesterday, I was curious about the internals of cloudpickle and whether a monkey-patched object would remain patched after being loaded remotely. I read a bit of the source, but figured just trying it was a good idea.</description></item><item><title>My Python testing set up</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/how_i_test/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/how_i_test/</guid><description>To follow up on the last post about testing for science and data analytics, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to talk about the specific tools I use for testing. I don&amp;rsquo;t claim this is the best way to do things, but it tends to work pretty well for small projects and teams.

And I think that&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s really hard. Almost all the introductions to automated testing that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen come from a more typical software engineering perspective. They assume you already know exactly what the output of your code should be. And the trouble with science is that that&amp;rsquo;s rarely the case. I mean, if you knew the results ahead of time, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing science!</description></item><item><title>Sneaky (transparent) huge pages</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/sneaky-transparent-huge-pages/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/sneaky-transparent-huge-pages/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sparse n-body matrices</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/sparse_nbody/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/sparse_nbody/</guid><description>This is a sparsity plot of a matrix representing an approximate n-body interaction. The black dots are non-zeros in the matrix. Imagine 2000 stars, each exerting some gravitational pull on each of the other stars. This gravitational interaction could be represented by a dense matrix:
$$ A_{ij} = \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j|^2} $$
This works, but dense matrices can be slow when there are many stars. The cost of evaluating a matrix-vector product will scale like $O(n^2)$.</description></item><item><title>"Serializing" a function in C++</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/serialize_fnc_cpp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/serialize_fnc_cpp/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Setting up my website</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/setting_up_website/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/setting_up_website/</guid><description>I have a website now.
