      <description>A recent paper outlining our Galerkin BEM approach.
My tectonic and earthquake cycle research is supported by development of elastic boundary element software. This has required investigations into the best approaches for a wide range of computational and mathematical tasks: singular integration of Green&amp;rsquo;s functions, approximation of farfield Green&amp;rsquo;s function interactions with the fast multipole method, flexible treatment of equality and inequality constraints, and a big dose of computational geometry. These are a just a few of the components of this effort.</description>

      <title>Earthquake cycle modeling of the Cascadia subduction zone</title>

      <description>Paper
The Cascadia subduction zone hosts great $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{W} &amp;gt; 8.5$ earthquakes, but studying these events is hindered by our short observational record. Earthquake cycle simulation provides an alternative window into the behavior of the subduction zone. Here, we present simulations over 3,800 years, 14 ruptures and hundreds of slow slip events on a high-fidelity geometric representation of the Cascadia subduction zone beneath surface topography. The boundaries of these ruptures are defined by ephemeral stress barriers that last for several cycles but are eliminated by a barrier-crossing rupture.</description>

      <title>Topography and the shallow slip deficit inference</title>

      <description>Paper
Images of earthquake slip typically rely on flat Earth physical models to link surface observations to fault activity at depth despite the extreme topographic relief (20%) in vicinity of recent great earthquakes (e.g., 2008 $M_w$=7.9 Wenchuan). Here we use a three-dimensional boundary element approach to characterize the effects of realistic topography on coseismic slip inversions and find that near the steepest topography, the flat Earth assumption may induce errors $&amp;gt;100%$ in imaged coseismic slip.</description>

      <title>Simplified distributed task parallelism</title>

      <description>Task-based parallelism enables running complex parallel computations by describing them as a graph of tasks. Shared memory task-based parallelism has become an important tool as demonstrated by tools like Intel TBB, Cilk, and OpenMP v3. But, distributed memory task-based parallelism systems is still heavily researched to determine the most usable, efficient and scalable approach. Instead of waiting for the future holy grail of distributed task parallelism, I designed Taskloaf while visiting Oak Ridge National Lab in Fall 2015.</description>

      <title>Neural-net-accelerated viscoelastic calculations.</title>

      <description>The viscous behavior of the deep Earth results in slow surface motion continuing for many years after an earthquake. However, computing the physics of this behavior can be extremely expensive involving multi-dimensional inverse Laplace transforms and slowly-convergent series. We developed a basic feedforward neural network that is able to replicate the results of the analytic computation while running ~500x faster. Since the analytic function being approximated is already known, this is a sort of strange application of neural networks in that they are very explicitly being used in their role as universal function approximators for a high-dimensional function.</description>

      <description>Quantitative estimates of crustal stress magnitude and orientation are hard to come by. On the other hand, geodesy is providing an increasingly accurate picture of global tectonic motions. Field and laboratory analyses contribute fault slip rates and exhumation rates. Seismology yields estimates of stress from moment tensor analyses. I am working to combine these data sources with geometrically accurate elastic boundary element models to estimate the crustal stress field and the driving forces behind those stresses &amp;ndash; for example, mantle tractions on the base of the crust.</description>

      <description>GRL article.
The Longmen Shan is the steepest topographic front at the India‐Asia collision zone and the site of the Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. To explain the interseismic GPS velocities across the greater Longmen Shan region, we developed a boundary element model including earthquake cycle effects, topography, the westward dipping Beichuan Fault and a ∼20 km deep, shallowly dipping, detachment, inferred from observed afterslip and from structural considerations. Prior analyses which had neglected the detachment and earthquake cycle effects found shortening rates near zero.</description>

      <description>My undergraduate thesis. Western Mongolia has experienced four of the largest strike-slip earthquakes in recorded history. The Gobi-Altai fault system is a 500km long left-lateral slip zone. The Altai fault system is a 1000km long right-lateral slip zone. Combined these fault systems accomodate 10-15% of the shortening in the Indo-Eurasian collision. At the intersection, complex kinematics have created a 150 x 100km basin, called the Shargyn Basin. I propose an explanation for the kinematics of the ongoing formation of the basin.</description>

      <title>Machine vision for microscale rock deformation</title>

      <description>github
For an undergraduate research project, I worked with Alejandra to automate a procedure to quantify finite strain on a microscale. On a certain surface, a sample is etched (like a microprocessor) with spaced dots. Then, on a microscope photograph, the dot positions are recorded before and after deformation. However, tracking hundreds of thousands of these dots by hand is impossible. So, I worked on an algorithm to determine the deformation function between the initial and final images by tracking the dot positions.</description>

      <description>In high school, I was very interested in machine learning algorithms and investigated neural networks, support vector machines and unsupervised learning. I replicated various algorithms and tested their properties at different points in parameter space on the MNIST dataset which contains 60,000 handwritten numbers. Later, I used an unsupervised learning technique (Autoencoders, Hinton et. al 2006) to improve the performance of a support vector machine model in detecting Melanoma (skin cancer).</description>

      <title>Regularizing rate and state friction for numerical simulation.</title>

      <guid>http://tbenthompson.com/post/regularized_rate_state/</guid>
      <description>The standard form for rate and state friction produces undefined results for $V = 0$. Some algebra and calculus and microphysics lead to the commonly used regularized form that is still valid at $V=0$. This is based on the presentation in Rice and Ben-Zion 1996 and Lapusta et. al 2000. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing novel here, but the details of this sort of thing are often glossed over in the literature. So, while working it out for myself, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write it up!</description>

Figures first, explanations later!
Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some 3D quasidynamic earthquake modeling problems. We&amp;rsquo;re planning to add in some realistic geometries using tectosaur to see what influence that has on the earthquake cycle. While putting together that 3D model, I realized that it consists of two main pieces:
 The numerical methods for determining traction on the fault surface given the current values of slip everywhere on the fault (elasticity!</description>

      <title>Cloudpickle, serializing functions and monkey patching</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using cloudpickle in the internals of taskloaf for a while since it allows serializing almost all functions and objects. That&amp;rsquo;s really nice since it means I can pass arbitrary functions (tasks, jobs) from one worker to another across the network.
Yesterday, I was curious about the internals of cloudpickle and whether a monkey-patched object would remain patched after being loaded remotely. I read a bit of the source, but figured just trying it was a good idea.</description>

      <description>To follow up on the last post about testing for science and data analytics, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to talk about the specific tools I use for testing. I don&amp;rsquo;t claim this is the best way to do things, but it tends to work pretty well for small projects and teams.
py.test The py.test tool is handy for running a suite of tests in python. It&amp;rsquo;s a very general tool for running all the tests in a project.</description>

      <description>A lot of scientists and data analysts don&amp;rsquo;t use automatic test suites for verifying their code. And I think that&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s really hard. Almost all the introductions to automated testing that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen come from a more typical software engineering perspective. They assume you already know exactly what the output of your code should be. And the trouble with science is that that&amp;rsquo;s rarely the case. I mean, if you knew the results ahead of time, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing science!</description>

      <description>This is a sparsity plot of a matrix representing an approximate n-body interaction. The black dots are non-zeros in the matrix. Imagine 2000 stars, each exerting some gravitational pull on each of the other stars. This gravitational interaction could be represented by a dense matrix:
$$ A_{ij} = \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j|^2} $$
This works, but dense matrices can be slow when there are many stars. The cost of evaluating a matrix-vector product will scale like $O(n^2)$.</description>

      <description>I have a website now. Since technical stuff is fun, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share the way I set it up.
The site is a set of statically served HTML pages. Hugo makes this really easy. Hugo is super fast and is written in Go. You can set up a few template pages and then write posts and pages in Markdown. Some layout is also done using Go templates. Running Hugo takes your templates and pages and concerts them into static HTML.</description>
