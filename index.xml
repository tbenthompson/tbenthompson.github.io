&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m particularly excited about being part of the team that released the first two open source packages from QuantCo. We built &lt;a href="https://github.com/Quantco/glum/">glum&lt;/a> as the generalized linear modeling package that we had all wished existed. And that project led to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Quantco/tabmat/">tabmat&lt;/a> as a backend for efficiently working with tabular matrix data containing a mix of dense, sparse and categorical subcomponents.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>cppimport: Import C++ files directly from Python!</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/cppimport/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/cppimport/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/tbenthompson/cppimport">See the GitHub repo&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GPU-accelerated symmetric Galerkin boundary element software</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/tectosaur/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/tectosaur/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://eartharxiv.org/xzhuk/">A recent paper outlining our Galerkin BEM approach.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My tectonic and earthquake cycle research is supported by development of elastic boundary element software. This has required investigations into the best approaches for a wide range of computational and mathematical tasks: singular integration of Green&amp;rsquo;s functions, approximation of farfield Green&amp;rsquo;s function interactions with the fast multipole method, flexible treatment of equality and inequality constraints, and a big dose of computational geometry. These are a just a few of the components of this effort. This new software will be able to model arbitrary geometries including surface topography, complex data-derived fault geometries, and material boundaries. Models with millions of elements will be possible in two or three dimensions. Exciting!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Earthquake cycle modeling of the Cascadia subduction zone</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/quasidynamic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/quasidynamic/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://eartharxiv.org/3vuxw/">Paper&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cascadia subduction zone hosts great $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{W} &amp;gt; 8.5$ earthquakes, but studying these events is hindered by our short observational record. Earthquake cycle simulation provides an alternative window into the behavior of the subduction zone. Here, we present simulations over 3,800 years, 14 ruptures and hundreds of slow slip events on a high-fidelity geometric representation of the Cascadia subduction zone beneath surface topography. The boundaries of these ruptures are defined by ephemeral stress barriers that last for several cycles but are eliminated by a barrier-crossing rupture. Thus, it is possible that many real world rupture barriers are due to remnant stress shadows from previous slip events and may not persist over several earthquake cycles. In addition, we see &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; slow slip events with $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{W} \approx 8$. These events may occur in nature and reduce the seismically available moment for earthquakes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Topography and the shallow slip deficit inference</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/topography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/topography/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://osf.io/sp3bj/">Paper&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Images of earthquake slip typically rely on flat Earth physical models to link surface observations to fault activity at depth despite the extreme topographic relief (20%) in vicinity of recent great earthquakes (e.g., 2008 $M_w$=7.9 Wenchuan).
Here we use a three-dimensional boundary element approach to characterize the effects of realistic topography on coseismic slip inversions and find that near the steepest topography, the flat Earth assumption may induce errors $&amp;gt;100%$ in imaged coseismic slip.
Additionally, we show that the flat earth assumption even in regions with small topographic gradients (1-5% , 1992 $M_w$=7.3 Landers) can lead to the inaccurate inference of a shallow slip deficit.
This illustrates how physical model errors can be amplified by an order of magnitude in estimating images of coseismic fault slip and that more physically realistic models may be required for accurate inference in an era of rapidly growing geodetic databases.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Simplified distributed task parallelism</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/taskloaf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/taskloaf/</guid><description>&lt;p>Task-based parallelism enables running complex parallel computations by describing them as a graph of tasks. Shared memory task-based parallelism has become an important tool as demonstrated by tools like Intel TBB, Cilk, and OpenMP v3. But, distributed memory task-based parallelism systems is still heavily researched to determine the most usable, efficient and scalable approach. Instead of waiting for the future holy grail of distributed task parallelism, I designed Taskloaf while visiting Oak Ridge National Lab in Fall 2015. Taskloaf is a minimal but reasonably efficient and scalable task parallelism library. A primary goal with the library was to keep it small and easy to maintain. The codebase has less than 2k lines of code so that a skilled C++ programmer can learn the inner workings of the entire library in a day. The interface is based around &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises">futures&lt;/a>, a time-tested parallelism primitive. I use Taskloaf to parallelize my boundary element software.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Neural-net-accelerated viscoelastic calculations.</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/visconn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/visconn/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://tbenthompson.com/images/nn_grl.jpeg"/>
&lt;p>The viscous behavior of the deep Earth results in slow surface motion continuing for many years after an earthquake. However, computing the physics of this behavior can be extremely expensive involving multi-dimensional inverse Laplace transforms and slowly-convergent series. We developed a basic feedforward neural network that is able to replicate the results of the analytic computation while running ~500x faster. Since the analytic function being approximated is already known, this is a sort of strange application of neural networks in that they are very explicitly being used in their role as universal function approximators for a high-dimensional function. It works really well!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crustal stress estimation in the Himalayan wedge</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/himalaya_stress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/himalaya_stress/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quantitative estimates of crustal stress magnitude and orientation are hard to come by. On the other hand, geodesy is providing an increasingly accurate picture of global tectonic motions. Field and laboratory analyses contribute fault slip rates and exhumation rates. Seismology yields estimates of stress from moment tensor analyses. I am working to combine these data sources with geometrically accurate elastic boundary element models to estimate the crustal stress field and the driving forces behind those stresses &amp;ndash; for example, mantle tractions on the base of the crust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Longmen Shan fault geometry and slip rates</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/longmenshan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/longmenshan/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL062833/abstract">GRL article&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Longmen Shan is the steepest topographic front at the India‐Asia collision zone and the site of the Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. To explain the interseismic GPS velocities across the greater Longmen Shan region, we developed a boundary element model including earthquake cycle effects, topography, the westward dipping Beichuan Fault and a ∼20 km deep, shallowly dipping, detachment, inferred from observed afterslip and from structural considerations. Prior analyses which had neglected the detachment and earthquake cycle effects found shortening rates near zero. In contrast, we found that interseismic GPS data are consistent with a shortening rate of 5.7±1.5mm/yr and maximum surface slip‐deficit rate of 9.5±2.5mm/yr. This model unifies the interpretation of geodetic deformation throughout the earthquake cycle and suggests that the Longmen Shan is an active fold‐and‐thrust belt with Wenchuan‐like recurrence intervals as short as 600 years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Neotectonics of the Shargyn Basin, western Mongolia</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/shargyn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/shargyn/</guid><description>&lt;p>My undergraduate thesis. Western Mongolia has experienced four of the largest strike-slip earthquakes in recorded history. The Gobi-Altai fault system is a 500km long left-lateral slip zone. The Altai fault system is a 1000km long right-lateral slip zone. Combined these fault systems accomodate 10-15% of the shortening in the Indo-Eurasian collision. At the intersection, complex kinematics have created a 150 x 100km basin, called the Shargyn Basin. I propose an explanation for the kinematics of the ongoing formation of the basin. The main source of data is a 3 month field season in Mongolia.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Machine vision for microscale rock deformation</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/microscale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/microscale/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/tbenthompson/microdeform">github&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For an undergraduate research project, I worked with &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4uDVRD0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en">Alejandra&lt;/a> to automate a procedure to quantify finite strain on a microscale. On a certain surface, a sample is etched (like a microprocessor) with spaced dots. Then, on a microscope photograph, the dot positions are recorded before and after deformation. However, tracking hundreds of thousands of these dots by hand is impossible. So, I worked on an algorithm to determine the deformation function between the initial and final images by tracking the dot positions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TherapyCharts</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/therapycharts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/therapycharts/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.therapycharts.com/">homepage&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I worked for a while as the primary software developer for TherapyCharts, a web-based therapist records system. I developed a Python and PostgreSQL based backend and a ExtJS interface. I participated in two American Psychological Association conferences performing support and sales for TherapyCharts. TherapyCharts has now partnered with Wiley Publishing and is known as “Therascribe powered by TherapyCharts”.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Machine learning, neural networks, and melanoma</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/project/neuralnets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/project/neuralnets/</guid><description>&lt;p>In high school, I was very interested in machine learning algorithms and investigated neural networks, support vector machines and unsupervised learning. I replicated various algorithms and tested their properties at different points in parameter space on the MNIST dataset which contains 60,000 handwritten numbers. Later, I used an unsupervised learning technique (Autoencoders, Hinton et. al 2006) to improve the performance of a support vector machine model in detecting Melanoma (skin cancer). My technique had a false negative and positive rate similar to experienced doctors. I presented some of these results at ISEF 2007, 2008 and 2009.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dreaming with sparse autoencoder features</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/sae_dreamy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/sae_dreamy/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://confirmlabs.org/posts/sae_dream.html">This is a link post for a tutorial on using dreaming (aka feature visualization) on sparse autoencoder features.

We have a &lt;a href="https://confirmlabs.org/posts/dreamy.html">companion page here demonstrating the code&lt;/a>. We also have &lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B0dM7du91BUkT7tSICXjKL7lrBAEdSa-?usp=sharing">a demo Colab notebook here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dreaming, aka &amp;ldquo;feature visualization,&amp;rdquo; is a interpretability approach popularized by DeepDream that involves optimizing the input of a neural network to maximize an internal feature like a neuron&amp;rsquo;s activation. We adapt dreaming to language models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Past dreaming work almost exclusively works with vision models because the inputs are continuous and easily optimized. Language model inputs are discrete and hard to optimize. To solve this issue, we adapted techniques from the adversarial attacks literature (GCG, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043">Zou et al 2023&lt;/a>). Our algorithm, Evolutionary Prompt Optimization (EPO), optimizes over a Pareto frontier of activation and fluency:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Extreme website and app blocking</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/lots_of_blocks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/lots_of_blocks/</guid><description>&lt;p>Computers are awesome.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The newbie/shallow learner&lt;/strong>: they are just getting into a field and need to understand some subject.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The deep researcher&lt;/strong>: they spend their days doing research in this area and need to keep up to date with what other researchers are doing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Currently, the scientific literature doesn’t really satisfy either type of user:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Newbies need more review articles and textbooks.&lt;/strong> These are often not available for concepts and research from the last 10 years. Review articles are currently quite rare especially for new or fast moving fields and are not well incentivized by the career process. They are normally written by altruistic, often tenured, senior researchers&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Textbooks are similar.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unexpectedly sucky things I've noticed about grad school</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/grad_school/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/grad_school/</guid><description>&lt;p>Summary: I think graduate school is largely a mistake for everyone involved.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Graduate students are poorly paid, low-skill but high potential, junior employees who need a lot more supervision and mentorship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Graduate students in many fields are thrust into a role where they need to decide on a research direction. Developing research taste is difficult and expecting graduate students to succeed at this is a great way to be disappointed.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the lab sciences, it seems less common to need to choose your own research direction. But, you still need to attach yourself to a particular lab.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> And the choice of lab will have huge ramifications for the value of your work and your career prospects. So, the situation is actually worse than in fields that require research taste, because you’re forced to make this single high consequence decision right at the beginning of grad school when you have the least knowledge and experience to make a good decision.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Very few other people have strong incentives to help graduate students succeed. It&amp;rsquo;s often necessary to be pushy and ask for help or feedback.&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> By comparison, in many other jobs, your coworkers depend on your work and are constantly asking you about it. This lack of aligned incentives in grad school can also lead to habits that are counterproductive in future careers, like under-communicating, having an overly adversarial or transactional mindset, or sometimes solving problems by being dogged and pushy rather than just finding a more solvable problem or a work-around.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students rarely have effective managers or mentors. Even a small amount of explicit management effort goes a long way.&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Effective managers and mentors are common in the private sector, and people with a bad manager can just switch jobs.&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some first year graduate students are fully prepared for the independence and challenge of professional research and do a phenomenally good job. Graduate school is failing these students too because there&amp;rsquo;s almost no way to promote them quickly into a position of power and influence!&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Sometimes 24 year olds successfully start massively successful companies. It seems that some 24 year olds should also be well funded principal investigators.&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students are paid an arbitrary rate completely unconnected to their market rate as researchers. &lt;sup id="fnref:9">&lt;a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Some fields have high industry earning potential and students have two month summer internships that pay more than the student receives for the entire rest of the year. This filters for students that are already financially well off. Other fields have very little industry earning potential. This &lt;em>really&lt;/em> filters for financially secure students.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This rate is also unconnected to how much their advisor/manager values them. Good students are rewarded by eventually getting tenure 15 years later. This is silly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Graduate students are locked into this pay rate for 4-8 years, a time frame during which their skills have increased massively and they could have (easily) more than doubled their income in the private sector.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Graduate students are normally not able to move between labs. It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon for someone to hop between two or three jobs over a few years before settling into one that turns out to be a good fit for a longer time frame. This is basically impossible in graduate school where switching advisors is difficult, much less switching universities!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When graduate students leave a lab, their projects often die because many graduate students are working on a solo project. This is a significant drag on research progress.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Graduate school is notoriously bad for mental health. &lt;a href="https://www.valentinbolotnyy.com/publication/graduatementalhealth/">This paper by Val Bolotnyy&lt;/a> presents evidence that “24.8% experience moderate or severe symptoms of depression or anxiety - more than two times the population average.”&lt;sup id="fnref:10">&lt;a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> This is almost surely exacerbated by the above issues. It’s hard to feel good about yourself when it seems like you’re working extremely hard on problems that no one else is really invested in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There’s a lot of potential for abuse. Students often can’t leave a research team or university during grad school without completely leaving academia or switching fields. Students on visas are particularly vulnerable because they can’t leave their program without completely leaving the United States.&lt;sup id="fnref:11">&lt;a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The thing that ameliorates some of these problems a little is that most graduate students are smart and hard-working. But, this also makes some of the issues regarding mental health and poor management worse because students regularly burn out. There’s a strong stigma against &amp;ldquo;quitting&amp;rdquo; that plays right into the diligent attitude of many grad students. By contrast, in the tech/software engineering world I’ve worked in since grad school, everyone is constantly encouraging friends in bad jobs to quit.&lt;sup id="fnref:12">&lt;a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FAQ: Why should research scientists be at the center of our scientific workforce?</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/reasons_for_research_scientists/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/reasons_for_research_scientists/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;sub>Ideally, this will be a living document.

&lt;p>In most research settings, research scientists are the central characters. In industrial research, experienced research scientists and engineers are well paid and prestigious. In national labs, the main career path is as a research scientist. But in academia, research scientists are few and far between. In many fields, a faculty-as-manager paradigm dominates and the most experienced scientists are engaged in the management responsibilities of the modern professor. Instead, most research is executed on by graduate students.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We need technical research consultants.</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/technical_research_consulting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/technical_research_consulting/</guid><description>&lt;h5 id="prelude-research-scientists-and-research-consultants">Prelude: Research scientists and research consultants.&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>&lt;sub>This is a proposal for a new type of research organization that would provide technical support, particularly on things like lab equipment or computational methods or software: technical competencies that take a long time to develop and are mostly independent of the particular lab environment.&lt;/sub>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;sub>There&amp;rsquo;s a spectrum of hands-on technical researchers. On the one hand, research scientists are full-time technically talented team members that execute on research plans. They have deep knowledge of the research in the lab and can help maintain continuity and keep execution speed high. On the other end of the specrum, research consultants are briefly involved in many different projects. Research consultants are valuable less for their deep knowledge of a particular research agenda and more for a particular skill that they have developed to a high degree. Ultimately, I think we need many more research scientists than research consultants. But right now, we have too few of both.&lt;/sub>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open source release!

&lt;p>While working on this project, my coworkers and I heard repeatedly from folks on other data science or economics teams that they either struggled with the same GLM software problems we had or they had built their own internal GLM tool similar to &lt;code>glum&lt;/code>.

It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get buried in giant pile of code and have no idea where to look for bugs. It&amp;rsquo;s even harder when actually the bug isn&amp;rsquo;t in the code but is in the concepts, math or data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fundamental problem with testing and debugging scientific software is that we don&amp;rsquo;t know correct intermediate values or even the correct final output. &lt;a href="https://tbenthompson.com/post/automated_testing_for_science/">I helped write a previous post on similar topics&lt;/a> but I wanted to write more on the topic. So, here are various suggestions that probably would&amp;rsquo;ve helped me at some point. I&amp;rsquo;d like to expand quite a bit more on individual points here in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gaussian quadrature is not optimal</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/better_than_gauss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/better_than_gauss/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s conventional wisdom that Gaussian quadrature is the most point-efficient quadrature formula for analytic functions.

&lt;p>I just finished reading &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work">Deep Work&lt;/a> and it has me thinking about applying a few of the concepts well beyond my career. &amp;ldquo;Deep work&amp;rdquo; is all about making space for the hard intellectual work at the core of most knowledge workers&amp;rsquo; jobs. But, the concept of making space in your day or week or month for deep thought seems like it should apply well beyond my career. Reflective deep work could even be a unifying theme for a lot of self-help or productivity advice. In some parts of life, I operate on auto-pilot almost all the time. If I&amp;rsquo;m brushing my teeth, that&amp;rsquo;s perfect. But, in other situations, it would be better to occasionally stop and think.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why it's okay to share your code</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/share_your_code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/share_your_code/</guid><description>&lt;p>TL;DR: If you write a paper that involves complex code, share your code freely online.

&lt;p>People have talked a lot already about why it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to share code with your research. I want to address a specific component of this. The desire to share good, well-maintained code often becomes a barrier to sharing any code at all. So, here, I&amp;rsquo;d just like to say that we love you, and we love your code too.

We also include a topographic free surface. How should we model this surface?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should we use planar triangles to model a curved fault? What happens at the junction between two triangles? If we do the natural fault thing and require the slip to be tangential to the suface, the slip vector has a step function at the junction between the two triangles. This must be true because the two triangles have different normal vectors and tangent vectors. On the other hand, if we force slip to be continuous across triangles, we have to allow non-tangential slip because at an edge where two triangles meet the slip vector has to be identical but the tangent vectors are different.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cool video of Cascadia earthquake cycle simulations</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cascadia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cascadia/</guid><description>&lt;iframe width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ieN-9MUhND8?start=112" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe></description></item><item><title>130 million triangular dislocations per second with Python/CUDA</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cutde/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cutde/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/tbenthompson/cutde">See the GitHub repo&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CLUDA - Write once, run anywhere with both CUDA and OpenCL.</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cluda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/cluda/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/tbenthompson/cluda">See the GitHub repo&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Regularizing rate and state friction for numerical simulation</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/regularized_rate_state/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/regularized_rate_state/</guid><description>&lt;p>The standard form for rate and state friction produces undefined results for $V = 0$.

&lt;p>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some 3D quasidynamic earthquake modeling problems. We&amp;rsquo;re planning to add in some realistic geometries using tectosaur to see what influence that has on the earthquake cycle. While putting together that 3D model, I realized that it consists of two main pieces:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The numerical methods for determining traction on the fault surface given the current values of slip everywhere on the fault (elasticity!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The frictional evolution for determining the current velocity on the fault surface from the traction.&lt;/li>

That&amp;rsquo;s really nice since it means I can pass arbitrary functions (tasks, jobs) from one worker to another across the network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday, I was curious about the internals of &lt;code>cloudpickle&lt;/code> and whether a monkey-patched object would remain patched after being loaded remotely.

I don&amp;rsquo;t claim this is the best way to do things, but it tends to work pretty well for small projects and teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pytest">py.test&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The py.test tool is handy for running a suite of tests in python. It&amp;rsquo;s a very general tool for running all the tests in a project. It can do a lot of powerful things, but requires almost no boilerplate to get started with. The pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve always followed is: Add a &lt;code>tests&lt;/code> directory the root of the project. Name any test files in that directory &lt;code>test_xyz.py&lt;/code> and then any tests within that file &lt;code>def test_abc():&lt;/code>. py.test will find all of these automatically and run them. On several projects that I work on, I have tens or hundreds of tests that, in total, take less than a second to run. As a result, I simply run &lt;code>py.test&lt;/code> every time I make a change.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automated testing for scientists and data analysts</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/automated_testing_for_science/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/automated_testing_for_science/</guid><description>&lt;p>A lot of scientists and data analysts don&amp;rsquo;t use automatic test suites for verifying their code.
And I think that&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s really hard.
Almost all the introductions to automated testing that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen come from a more typical software engineering perspective. They assume you already know exactly what the output of your code should be.
And the trouble with science is that that&amp;rsquo;s rarely the case.
I mean, if you knew the results ahead of time, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing science!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sneaky (transparent) huge pages</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/sneaky-transparent-huge-pages/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/sneaky-transparent-huge-pages/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sparse n-body matrices</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/sparse_nbody/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/sparse_nbody/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tbenthompson.com/images/sparse_treecode_matrix.png" alt="matrix">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a sparsity plot of a matrix representing an approximate n-body interaction. The black dots are non-zeros in the matrix. Imagine 2000 stars, each exerting some gravitational pull on each of the other stars. This gravitational interaction could be represented by a dense matrix:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
A_{ij} = \frac{G m_i m_j}{|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j|^2}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This works, but dense matrices can be slow when there are many stars. The cost of evaluating a matrix-vector product will scale like $O(n^2)$. Fortunately, the matrix can be represented in a different way if a little bit of error is okay. The interactions can be separated into those between nearby stars and the remaining interactions between stars that are far from each other. Groups of farfield interactions can be approximated. The result is a matrix that looks like what I&amp;rsquo;m showing above. The matrix has four distinct blocks. The upper left 2000x2000 block of the matrix represents the direct interaction that could not be approximated. The lower left and lower right represent the evaluation of the approximation coefficients. Both are super sparse! The upper right is the evaluation of the influence of the approximation coefficients on the points themselves. This part is less sparse.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"Serializing" a function in C++</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/serialize_fnc_cpp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/serialize_fnc_cpp/</guid><description>&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/tbenthompson/94fd4095f89da23dec20.js">&lt;/script></description></item><item><title>Setting up my website</title><link>https://tbenthompson.com/post/setting_up_website/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/post/setting_up_website/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have a website now.

&lt;p>I find messaging tools to be distracting and block them during the work day and at night. When I say &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo;, I don’t mean that notifications will be off; I mean that I will be physically incapable of sending texts or using apps like Signal, WhatsApp or Zulip. My phone will probably be in a lock box and all that stuff is completely blocked on my laptop. If you need to contact me urgently and it can’t wait until I’m done working, you should call me. Call twice less than two minutes apart and I should receive your call even if I have my phone on silent. One big advantage of this state of affairs is that you should feel free to spam me with dozens of messages during the work day - you won’t disrupt me because I can’t even look at the messages!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://tbenthompson.com/thanks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tbenthompson.com/thanks/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="your-subscription-is-confirmed">Your subscription is confirmed.&lt;/h2>
